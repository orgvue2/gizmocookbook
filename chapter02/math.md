## Mathematical operations: Math.()

There are a range of `Math.()`functions for performing more complex mathematical expressions. The Math.() functions all take a similar form and all require arguments in ().

```js
Math.function(argument)
```
### Examples
`Math.round(x)` Rounds x to the nearest integer.

`Math.round(x*100)/100` Rounds x to the different decimal places.

`Math.floor(x)` Rounds down to the nearest integer.

`Math.ciel(x)` Rounds up to the nearest integer.

`Math.abs(x)` Returns the absolute value of x.

`Math.pow(x,y)` Returns the value of x to the power of y.

`Math.sqrt(x)` Returns the square root of x.

`Math.log(x)` Returns the natural logarithm (base E) of x.

`Math.random()` Returns a random number between 0 and 1.

`Math.PI` Returns  Ï€ (pi), the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, commonly approximated as 3.14159.
