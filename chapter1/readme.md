# Introduction to Gizmo expressions

OrgVue’s scripting language Gizmo allows you to perform querying, calculations, aggregations and transformations.


#### Typical use cases of Gizmo Expressions


1. Quickly get answers to complex questions, e.g. 
	* what is the total revenue per employee of the sales department
	* what is the median of the age of all female program managers
	
	** Note: ** Compared to Filter Control, Search Box and various visualisation options, Gizmo can be quicker to get an answer to complex and specific questions, and it further allows manipulation of the results.

2. Create custom metrics using existing data, e.g.
    * ratio of front to back office staff
    * benfits as a percent of salary
3. Manipulate text and numbers, e.g.
    * increase everyone’s salary by 10%.
    * convert employees’ performance score in numbers to A, B, C and D
