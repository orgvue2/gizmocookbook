## Calling methods
There are a number of methods which allow you to further manipulate the accessed collection.

The . (‘dot’) syntax is used to call methods on a collection. 

The methods have **( )** after them. The brackets contain the expression's ‘arguments’ - that is, the *input* on which it acts.
