## Keep your tenant tidy
How quickly your tenant opens and performs depends on 3 main factors:
1. The **number** of datasets (inc. links and reports) it contains
2. The **size** of those datasets
3. The amount and **complexity** of calculations across the tenant

To make your tenant run as fast as possible, you should consider:
* Deleting old (versions of) datasets
* Only creating links between datasets that are being consistently used
* Combining lookup datasets so they do not overlap, i.e. no 2 lookups share the same unique id
* Storing any scripts (e.g. for custom dashboards, colour palettes, or containing lots of expressions) centrally. For more information on how to implement this, get in touch with your Super User or an OrgVue consultant
